      title: "Understanding Phishing Attacks",
      content: `Phishing is a cybercrime where attackers impersonate legitimate organizations to steal sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers, or personal data.

**Common Signs of Phishing:**
- Urgent or threatening language
- Requests for personal information
- Suspicious sender addresses
- Generic greetings like "Dear Customer"
- Unusual links or attachments

**Why Phishing Works:**
Phishing attacks exploit human psychology rather than technical vulnerabilities. They create a sense of urgency or fear to make victims act quickly without thinking.`,
      tips: [
        "Always verify the sender's identity through official channels",
        "Look for spelling and grammar mistakes in messages",
        "Hover over links to see the actual destination",
        "Be suspicious of urgent requests for personal information",
        "When in doubt, contact the organization directly"

      content: `Email remains the primary vector for phishing attacks. Advanced phishing emails often look incredibly convincing and use sophisticated techniques.

**Advanced Phishing Techniques:**
- Domain spoofing (using similar-looking domains)
- Email header manipulation
- HTML formatting to hide malicious links
- Social engineering based on public information
- Business Email Compromise (BEC) attacks

**Email Authentication:**
Modern email systems use SPF, DKIM, and DMARC to authenticate legitimate emails. However, these aren't foolproof, and attackers constantly evolve their techniques.`,
      tips: [
        "Check the email headers for authentication failures",
        "Be extra cautious with emails requesting wire transfers",
        "Verify requests through phone calls, not email replies",
        "Look for inconsistencies in sender names and addresses",

**Common Social Engineering Tactics:**
- Authority (impersonating bosses or officials)
- Urgency (creating time pressure)
- Fear (threats of consequences)
- Reciprocity (offering something first)
- Social proof (claiming others have complied)
- Scarcity (limited time offers)

**Vishing and Smishing:**
Voice phishing (vishing) uses phone calls, while SMS phishing (smishing) uses text messages. Both can be highly effective as they seem more personal and immediate than emails.`,
